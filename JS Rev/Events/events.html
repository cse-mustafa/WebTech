      Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov[a] (born 20 September 1988) is a
      Russian former professional mixed martial artist who competed in the
      Lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was
      the longest-reigning UFC Lightweight Champion ever, having held the title
      from April 2018 to March 2021. With 29 wins and no losses, he retired with
      an undefeated record.[8] Nurmagomedov is widely considered to be among the
      greatest mixed martial artists of all time,[9][10][11][12][13] and was
      inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame on June 30, 2022.[14] A two-time world
      champion in combat sambo, Nurmagomedov has a background in wrestling,
      judo, and sambo. Nurmagomedov was ranked #1 in the UFC men's
      pound-for-pound rankings at the time of his retirement,[15] until being
      removed following his title vacation in March 2021.[16] Fight Matrix ranks
      him as the #1 lightweight of all time.[17] In 2019, Forbes ranked
      Nurmagomedov as the No. 1 most successful Russian athlete; Nurmagomedov
      also topped the list of the 40 most successful Russian show business and
      sports personalities under 40.
