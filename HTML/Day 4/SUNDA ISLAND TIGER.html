    <p style="color: white;">
      The Sunda Island tiger, or the Sumatran tiger, is the smallest tiger
      subspecies in the world, weighing up to 140kg. For reference, the tigers
      that live in the Amur region are the biggest of all the big cats where
      males can weigh up to twice as much as Sunda Island tigers. They are also
      very rare - there are estimated to be around 600 in the wild, and are only
      found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Since the 1980s, the human
      population of south-east Asia has nearly doubled from 357 million to
      around 668 million in 2020. And this has had an impact on tiger numbers,
      which have been shrinking along with their habitats. As human settlements
      expand in the region, Sunda Island tigers are increasingly likely to
      encounter people, which could lead to a further rise in human-tiger
      conflict. Tiger poaching and illegal trading of tiger parts and products
      are also of serious concern to their survival.
