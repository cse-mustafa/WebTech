      The Mountain gorilla is a subspecies of the eastern gorilla, which lives
      in two isolated populations in the high-altitude forests up in the
      volcanic, mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda
      and Uganda, and in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park of Uganda. The
      Virunga Landscape has a history of political instability along with high
      levels of poverty in the region. This poses a substantial threat to
      mountain gorilla numbers as people have moved into areas closer to these
      great apes for food, shelter and spaceâ€”over 500,000 people live near
      mountain gorilla habitat at present. Despite this, mountain gorillas are
      making a promising recovery with conservation efforts and interventions
      from local and international partners and the WWF through the
      International Gorilla Conservation Programme. At present, mountain
      gorillas are currently listed as endangered species, with just over 1,000
      individuals in the wild. However, multiple threats remain that can hinder
      recovery progress for this species.
