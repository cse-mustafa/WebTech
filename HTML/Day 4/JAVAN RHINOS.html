      Once found throughout south-east Asia, Javan rhinos have suffered a
      staggering decline in their numbers due to hunting and habitat loss. The
      lone wild population of Javan rhinos is one of the rarest of the rhino
      species—around 75 individuals—which can only be found on the island of
      Java, Indonesia. The Ujung Kulon National Park, a World Heritage Site, is
      the last remaining refuge of Javan rhinos. But the area also suffers from
      the invading Arenga palm, leaving the rhinos with less food to eat and
      less habitat to roam. Besides, the small Javan rhino population is also
      extremely vulnerable to extinction due to natural catastrophes, disease,
      poaching and potential inbreeding.
