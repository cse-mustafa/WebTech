      The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, with only
      around 100 individuals left in the wild. Although their wild population
      seems to be stable and increasing, these leopard subspecies are still
      critically endangered since 1996. And there is a good reason that: Amur
      leopards can only be found in a relatively small region of the far east of
      Russia and north-eastern China at present. The remaining Amur leopards
      face multiple threats to their survival, including habitat loss and
      fragmentation, prey scarcity and transportation infrastructure such as
      roads. However, there is hope for this rare big cat. Around 75% of their
      home range lies in protected areas in Russia and China, and they are also
      moving into suitable habitats outside of these protected areas.
