      Between 1960 and 1995, black rhino populations suffered dramatic losses in
      their numbers due to large-scale poaching. Around 2% survived the severe
      onslaught of the past. As rhino conservation took hold, their numbers have
      more than doubled across Africa since the 1990s. But, black rhinos are
      still listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, with around 5,630
      individuals in the wild. Three subspecies of black rhino now survive, with
      the western black rhino declared extinct in 2011. Today, 95% of black
      rhinos are found in just four countries: Kenya, Namibia, South Africa and
      Zimbabwe. The biggest threat to the remaining population is still poaching
      for their hornâ€”in the last 10 years, almost 10,000 African rhinos have
      been killed to supply the illegal rhino horn trade.
